# GameFun 🎮🪙

Empowering creators with on-chain community currencies

GameFun is a decentralized platform where verified YouTubers, Twitch streamers, and gamers can launch their own meme coins on the Solana blockchain. These coins represent the creator's brand and community identity — and can be collected, traded, and supported by their fans and subscribers.

✨ **Key Features**

* 🔗 YouTube/Twitch OAuth verification
* 🪙 Meme Coin Creator (with image, metadata, supply, price, etc.)
* 🖼️ Image + metadata storage via NFT.Storage (IPFS)
* ⚙️ SPL Token minting + Metaplex metadata attachment
* 🔐 Phantom wallet integration
* 📊 Real-time dashboard for each coin
* 📤 Fans can buy/sell meme coins as collectibles
* 🛒 Marketplace interface for coin discovery and trading

🛍️ **Use Case: Token Marketplace for Subscribers**

Subscribers can support their favorite creators by buying their meme coins. These tokens are tradable—allowing fans to speculate, collect, or engage in creator-led ecosystems. Each coin is visible in a marketplace dashboard where supply, pricing, and creator profiles are transparent.
